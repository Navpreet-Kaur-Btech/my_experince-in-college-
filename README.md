Today, I was having my first lecture of *Maths*. This lecture was taken by *Prof. RB Mam*. Sir taught us about *intregration*. First mam  started from basics  and taught us 
 the very basics of integration .

Them my lectures are about my chemistry basics . Thia lectues is taken by *PROF.MOK Mam* . Mam tuaght us the  basics of chemistry . Mam tols us to name the all chapters of chemisty we are studied in **11th and 12th class**

In my third lecture, I was having my MATHEMATICS test. It included the questions of Integration and Differentiation. And the test is so intersting . 

**In Evening** Post-test, I attended a meeting for CodeGNE, our college’s coding and tech club. Today’s session was particularly intriguing as students presented on OpenSCAD, an open-source software for 3D modeling. The presentation covered the basics of 3D design, from creating simple geometric shapes to more complex structures.  
I was fascinated by how code could translate into tangible designs, and it opened my eyes to the potential of 3D printing and modeling in various fields.
The highlight was a live demonstration where we saw how altering the code could change the design in real-time. It was an inspiring session, sparking ideas for future projects and collaborations. I’m eager to explore OpenSCAD further

Today was the last and 13th day of our induction program at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College. The day began with a thrilling hackathon named “Promising Hackers,” organized by Dr. H.S. Rai and Dr. Randhir Singh. I arrived a little early, and soon the competition started at 9:22 AM. 

 We were given one hour to create a 3D logo of our college using any open-source software. Additionally, we had to report our progress to the judges every ten minutes.
After the time was up, all participants and judges reviewed the outputs and decided on the winners. I’m proud to share that I secured the 2nd position in the hackathon! It was an exciting and challenging experience that tested our creativity and technical skills.

Following the hackathon, we gathered in the auditorium for a cultural competition. The first event was a singing competition, which everyone enjoyed. It was followed by a dance competition, which was equally entertaining and well-received by the audience. There was a short break before the prize ceremony.

During the prize ceremony, Dr. Inderpal Singh, Director of Nankana Sahib Education Trust (NSET), shared valuable insights and words of encouragement. Principal Dr. Sehijpal Singh and the HOD of the IT department, Dr. K.S. Maan, also addressed the gathering and distributed prizes to all the winners.

The day was a perfect blend of competition, creativity, and celebration, marking a memorable end to our induction program. Reflecting on these past 13 days, I feel grateful for the experiences and the bonds formed with fellow students. The program has provided a solid foundation for our future endeavors at the college, and I look forward to the challenges and opportunities that lie ah
